# MyClient is a Customer Relationship Management system

This a web-based application for running some customer-business operations in a medical spa clinic. It was designed for INTERNAL USE ONLY; thus, I am absolved from SQL injection vulnerabilites critique.

This web app allows for entry of new clients into a database, searching for customers, creates a profile and maintains business related about them, adds purchased session packages to thier profile, and searches for online orders.

Tech stack: PHP, MySQL, Javascript, Bootstrap css, Bootstrap js.
